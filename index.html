    <h1>We are here to help</h1>
    <h2>The All Stars Project has been working with young people to help them grow. Helping them get interships, show their talents, helping people in porr communities. All of these are very important to help youth people to get to their distination. But what about the others? Those who are enslaved as sex slaves? Who will be able to help them? Can we make a difference in our community and our world?</h2>

    <h2>My plan of action</h2>
    <p>Before I go further on, I want to introduce myself and my background: My name is Gerardo.Torres-Cashat. I am a senior at IDEA high school (Innovation Design Entrepreneurship Academy) and looking foward to go to college (not decided yet where) and help people throughout the world. I come from a rich parents and family, and when i mean by rich in my term, I mean by respect and the principles of helping out people. I have an internship in Airline Ambassadors International, which is about Human trafficking.</p>
